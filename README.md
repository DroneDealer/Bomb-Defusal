# Bomb Defusal
A game in which you have to solve a series of minigames to defuse a bomb without exploding due to loss of time or lives.

## Inspiration
I wanted to try making a simpler, high - stakes game instead of a more art or story based one. Creating this project helped teach me how to use more advanced, UI based minigames. Unfortunately, I faced many challenges (such as the scaling bugging out whenever I reopened the project) that were fixed by extensively playing with the UI settings.

## Controls
- The whole game uses **click-based UI**: complete the minigames through clicking various buttons.
- Use the number keys to type in a 4 - digit PIN to defuse the bomb.

## Features
- 3 unique minigames with distinct mechanics
- Time and life - based pressure system
- Polished UI with pause and win/lose states
- Immersive sound design and thematic fonts

## Gameplay
- There are 3 minigames for the player to choose from and all of them must be completed to defuse the bomb.
  - One is based off of timing button clicks correctly (Wire Cutter).
  - One is based off of memory (Simon Says).
  - One is based off of deduction and reasoning (Guess the PIN).
- The player has 15 lives across all 3 minigames and a total of 7 minutes before the bomb goes off.
